Hello Everyone i am Himanshu Adhikari  and this is my compiler's labwork that consisting of:
1.	Design a LEX Code to count the number of lines, space, tab-meta character and rest of characters in a given Input pattern. 
2.	Design a LEX Code to identify and print valid Identifier of C/C++ in given Input pattern. 
3.	Design a LEX Code to identify and print integer and float value in given Input pattern.
4.	Design a LEX Code for Tokenizing (Identify and print OPERATORS, SEPERATORS, KEYWORDS, IDENTIFERS) the following C-fragment:
int p=1,d=0,r=4,
float m=0.0, n=200.0,
while (p <= 3)
{ if(d==0)
{ m= m+n*r+4.5, d++,  }
else
{ r++, m=m+r+1000.0,  }
	p++,  }
LEX code using Regular Grammar (with file-handling):
5.	Design a LEX Code to count and print the number of total characters, words, white spaces in given ‘Input.txt’ file.
6.	Design a LEX Code to replace white spaces of ‘Input.txt’ file by a single blank character into ‘Output.txt’ file.
7.	Design a LEX Code to remove the comments from any C-Program given at run-time and store into ‘out.c’ file.
8.	Design a LEX Code to extract all html tags in the given HTML file at run time and store into Text file given at run time.
